# My first machine learning project

That was very nice Xmass project - my first playings with machine learning using https://github.com/keras-team/keras on my graphic card.
Sadly I abandon this project - there is not enough input data for deep machine learning algorithms so I'm moving forward to next project: https://github.com/jakubbujny/monitoring-deep-learning
